# Projects: Sinatra

*Don't forget to use Git to save your projects!*

## Project 1: A simple online game.

You've seen how simple it can be to get something up and running using Sinatra, in this project you'll be following a tutorial to create a simple number guessing game.

The tutorial leave most of the ruby code to you and just tells you how to do the new Sinatra stuff.  By this point the ruby code required should be pretty simple for you.

### Your Task

1. [Do this project/tutorial from Jumpstart Lab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html). Be sure to try out some of the Extensions at the end of the tutorial, that's the fun stuff!  
2.  Now might be a good time to remind yourself how HTML and CSS work, so take a _little_ time to make it look pretty before moving on.
